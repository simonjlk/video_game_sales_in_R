# Video Game Sales

The goal of this project was to find the optimum model between Random Forest and Lasso Regression to predict sales of a new video game in North America using R.

A summary is provided for the CEO, followed by an overview for the manager, then the technical report for a statistician. The different styles and content required for different stakeholders is demonstrated.

This project includes data cleaning, feature engineering, EDA, PCA, pre-processing including splits into training and testing datasets, and bootstrapping to tune both of the models. RMSE and R squared were the measures used to assess the accuracy of the models using the cross-validated pre-processed data.
